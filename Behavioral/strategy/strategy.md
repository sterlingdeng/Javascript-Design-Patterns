# Strategy Pattern

> Definition: Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the alogirthm vary independently from clients that use it.

Key Points:

- Provides the flexibility to select the behavior during runtime.
- Uses composition rather than inheritance. Composition is achieved by creating different algorithms that achieve a certain behavior.
