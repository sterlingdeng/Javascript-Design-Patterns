# Factory Pattern

> Definition: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses.

Key Points:

- Provides the flexibility to create classes during runtime, rather than at author time.
- Is used when we want to defer the instantiation of classes.
